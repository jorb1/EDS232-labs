    "Wildfires are increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change. Predicting tree mortality following a wildfire is critical for forest management, ecosystem recovery, and carbon sequestration planning. In this lab, we will build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of tree mortality one year after a wildfire\n",

    "The database we'll be working with today includes observations of individual trees involved in prescribed fires and wildfires occurring over 35 years, from 1981 to 2016. It is drawn from a fire and tree mortality database from the US Forest Service (see data description for the full database here: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0522-7#Sec10)).\n",
